SEX MARKERS NOTE

Attached are 2 fasta files labeled male and female, these are derived from multiple 
individual albacore from each sex.  Males are the heterogametic sex so youâ€™ll see a bunch
of ambiguity codes in the male sequence.  The Suda and Chiba papers on using the Bluefin
tuna primers on bluefin and other tuna species target the polymorphisms at positions 
191,198, 300, 301 but realistically any of the polymorphisms should work.
